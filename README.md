# Inheritance-Simulation
A test of class inheritance properties in python, with a custom GUI simulation to use a visualization

Finalized June, 2015, in Python.
Run 'script.py' to begin GUI and simulation.

How to begin and operate simulation
-- Click on an object type in the menu bar to begin spawning them in the window
-- Click where you want to spawn the object after clicking its type on the menu bar to spawn it, as many times
   as you'd like.
-- Click 'Remove' to remove any objects you'd like with the next few clicks.
-- Click 'Start' to begin the clock and see the simulation unfold. Objects can be added and removed during the simulation.
-- Click 'Stop' to pause the simulation. Objects can be added and removed while paused.
-- Click 'Reset' to pause, clear the simulation, and reset the clock to 0.

What the objects do:
-- Balls bounce on the window edge.
-- Floaters fly randomly
-- Black_Holes don't move or change in size but kill balls and floaters that come in contact
-- Pulsators are black holes that grow as they consume
-- Hunters are mobile black holes that actively seek balls and floaters
-- Specials (AKA Motherships) spawn parasites that seek balls and floaters, and bring them back to the mothership
